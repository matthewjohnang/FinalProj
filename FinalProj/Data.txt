Weather Reminder

As winter approaches, we want to remind you of our policy regarding absence due to severe weather conditions. Now is a good time to prepare your car for safe travel in winter weather; our employees' safety is our greatest concern. We have rarely found it necessary to close our offices completely, however, we have done so when road conditions are too hazardous for travel. If you are unsure about whether to report to work you may call our employee hotline at 555-5555. We will provide information concerning company hours In the case of severe weather or any other emergency. Employees are expected to be at work when the office is officially open; if you are unable to be at work you must notify your supervisor that you are taking personal leave.
